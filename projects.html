			<h3>Minecraft Steve</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Machining, January-March 2026</summary>
				<p id="steve">
					The prompt: in a team, a group designs a minimum two part piece that comes together.
					My team opted to make a figurine of Minecraft Steve with opposible limbs.
				</p>
				<p>
					So we did the college student thing and made an ambitious, 8-piece structure.
				</p>
				<p>
					The initial sketches below used a grid to ensure proportionality to the actual Minecraft Steve model.
					Since Steve's arms only rotated along one axis, we opted out of doing a ball joint and did an easier fit model.
				</p>
				<p>
					This design underwent multiple revisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially, we did not understand requirements for injection molding. 
					Parts needed to be hollow. 
					This complicated our design well past the initial 4 part mold.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our second design dealt with machinability constraints.
					Clearly, we still had a lot to learn.
					We also realized that using symmetry would only need to create four unique molds for tooling.
					This meant we could make our parts bigger to use more mold space and reduce tooling time.
				</p>
				<p>
					More teamwork, more design edits later, and our molds were finally finished.
					Now, off to the CAM process.
				</p>

			<h3 id="suction"">Suction Station</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Interdisciplinary Design Project, September 2025-March 2026.</summary>
				<p>Our client, the Morton Arboretum, approached us with a problem.
					They were two years behind sorting leaf litter for climate change research.
					Our job? Find a way to make the sorting the small pieces more efficient for their volunteers.
				</p>
				<p>
					We first determined a journey map of this process.
					Looking at the entire journey of the leaf litter from dirt to analysis, we found the biggest slowdown came from the manual sorting process.
				</p>
				<p>
					We designed and built a few low fidelity mockups and received feedback from our client and professionals in various industries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Halfway through, we ended up choosing to go all in on the suction station.
					This is because our users and client preferred using it over other ideas.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few more rounds of iteration and testing later...
				</p>
				<p>
					...leads to our final design!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you'd like to learn more about the whole process, a full report is available here.

			<h3 id="rainboots">Umbrella-Froggy Rainboots</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Industrial Design, March 2025</summary>
				<p>The prompt? Make an inventive pair of footwear. 
					Immediately, I wanted to design a cute pair of rainboots.</p>
				<p>
					When I think of rain, I think of puddles, mud, and everything frogs.
					I asked myself, do froggy rainboots exist already? 
					I was disappointed to find every pair of froggy rainboots were creepy or poor quality.
				</p>
				<p>
					I made it my job to do something about this injustice.
				</p>
				<p>
					I went through a lot of ideation with my thumbnails and initial sketches.
					First drafts ranged from exagerrated cuteness to high fashion.
					After receiving feedback from my professor and peers, I further narrowed my designs to a second draft.
				</p>
				<p>
					With these designs, I ended up going with the umbrella design.
					I further explored its shape and found the shape of an upside down umbrella to find it looked like a flower.
					So I turned it into a water lily when folded up.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on more feedback and refinement, this was the final design!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you'd like to learn more, a full report of the process is available here.

			<h3 id="hummingbird">Hummingbird Garden</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Industrial Design, May-June 2025</summary>
				<p>The prompt? Open-ended.</p>
				<p>What spoke to me? Hummingbirds. 
					Specifically hummingbird garden structures.</p>
				<p>
					I did a lot of research into what hummingbirds like.
					Turns out, hummingbirds are a lot pickier than I took them for.
					With those design considerations in mind, I made a number of initial sketches.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based off of feedback from hummingbird enthusiasts in my area, my peers, and further research, I sketched out more defined drafts.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the end, I created my final drafts in full color.
				</p>

			<h3 id="playplace">Play Place Hideout</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Industrial Design, April-May 2025</summary>
				<p>The prompt? Design a piece of furniture.</p>
				<p>I went through a lot of different ideas for this project a la my thumbnails and drafts.</p>
				<p>
					Something stood out to my inner child though.
					It was this combination of a McDonald's play place and a pillow fort.
					Truthfully, this is what I wanted the most in my life.
					So I sought to elaborate on it more.
				</p>
				<p>
					And here is the final result.
				</p>

			<h3 id="brakecalipers">Brake Calipers</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>CAD and FMEA, March-June 2025</summary>
				<p>
					Our professor assigned me in a group to design a set of brake calipers for a bike.
				</p>
				<p>
					They needed to be able to be added to an existing bike.
					Most importantly, they needed to be able to reliably stop the bike when the hand brake was squeezed.
				</p>
				<p>
					We first had to start with a lot of research within standards to make a specs chart.
					We did a lot of math here too.
				</p>
				<p>
					We went through a couple drafts.
					Using FMEA simulations on Siemen's NX, we determined more optimal geometry for the calipers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, we had our calipers 3D printed and tested in person.
					They worked swimmingly!
				</p>

			<h3 id="jack">Jack-In-the-Box Simulation</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Lagrangian Physics and Python, September-December 2024</summary>
				<p>
					For a final project, I simulated a jack in a box with Lagrangian mechanics.
					This was all done in Python using NumPy and SymPy libraries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Explaining this process is frankly pretty complicated. 
					But if you'd like to learn more, I wrote a paper about it that pretty comprehensively goes into all of the math.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's the final simulation below!
				</p>
			</details>

			<h3 id="DTC">Slide-It-On</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Design Project, January-March 2023</summary>
				<p>
					I worked with a client who survived a stroke and has difficulty with poor proprioception.
					Because of this, she has difficulty finding her hands in space when putting on the backings to her earrings.
				</p>
				<p>
					My team designed a device that allows her to attach her earring together all in one motion using both hands and aligned to the earing front.
