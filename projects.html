			<h3>Suction Station</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Interdisciplinary Design Project, September 2025-March 2026.</summary>
				<p>Our client, the Morton Arboretum, approached us with a problem.
					They were two years behind sorting leaf litter for climate change research.
					Our job? Find a way to make the sorting the small pieces more efficient for their volunteers.
				</p>
				<p>
					We first determined a journey map of this process.
					Looking at the entire journey of the leaf litter from dirt to analysis, we found the biggest slowdown came from the manual sorting process.
				</p>
				<p>
					We designed and built a few low fidelity mockups and received feedback from our client and professionals in various industries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Halfway through, we ended up choosing to go all in on the suction station.
					This is because our users and client preferred using it over other ideas.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few more rounds of iteration and testing later...
				</p>
				<p>
					...leads to our final design!

			<h3>Minecraft Steve</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>Machining, January-March 2026</summary>
				<p>
					The prompt: in a team, a group designs a minimum two part piece that comes together.
					My team opted to make a figurine of Minecraft Steve with opposible limbs.
				</p>
				<p>
					So we did the college student thing and made an ambitious, 8-piece structure.
				</p>
				<p>
					The initial sketches below used a grid to ensure proportionality to the actual Minecraft Steve model.
					Since Steve's arms only rotated along one axis, we opted out of doing a ball joint and did an easier fit model.
				</p>
				<p>
					This design underwent multiple revisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially, we did not understand requirements for injection molding. 
					Parts needed to be hollow. 
					This complicated our design well past the initial 4 part mold.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our second design dealt with machinability constraints.
					Clearly, we still had a lot to learn.
					We also realized that using symmetry would only need to create four unique molds for tooling.
					This meant we could make our parts bigger to use more mold space and reduce tooling time.
