	<h3>From design to engineering, there's a lot here.</h3>
</section>

<section id="suctionstation">
  <h3>Suction Station</h3>
	<p>Our client, the Morton Arboretum, is two years behind sorting tree litter for climate change research. 
		My team's job was to find a way to make volunteer sorting more easier and more efficient. 
		We also focused on ergonomics to help prevent sorting-related injuries.</p>
</section>

<section id="steve">
  <h3>Minecraft Steve Figurine</h3>
	<p>Our team was tasked with making a minimum two part injection molded item using our custom made tools. 
		So, as you do, we made an 8 part figure with opposable limbs.</p>
</section>

<section id="rainboot">
  <h3>Umbrella-Froggy Rainboots</h3>
	<p>My professor tasked me with making inventive footwear. 
		I love frogs and rainboots. 
		So I decided I was going to make a cute and fashionable froggy rainboot.</p>
</section>

<section id="hummingbird">
  <h3>Hummingbird Garden</h3>
	<p>For a final project, I was inspired by the spring weather and thought, "I miss seeing the hummingbirds." 
		And I thought to myself, "What if I made a collection of adorable hummingbird garden architecture?" 
		With the attention to detail of a nature lover who endlessly reads nature field guides of course.</p>

<section id="playplace">
	<h3>Play Place Hideout</h3>
	<p>In a furniture assignment, I designed a structure for lounging based off of a mix of a McDonald's play place and a pillow fort.</p>
</section>

<section id="caliper">
  <h3>Brake Calipers</h3>
	<p>My group was tasked to design brake calipers that could be attached to an existing bike. The goal? Safely stop it when the brake handle is triggered.</p>
</section>

<section id="busstop">
	<h3>Bus Stop</h3>
	<p>Northwestern's busstops are lackluster. I mean, there's no neither decorations or even benches. For a project, I designed a bus stop for Sheridan Road inspired by a disorderly classroom. All in purple pride.</p>
</section>

<section id="echo">
	<h3>Echo Flower Speaker</h3>
	<p>For a sprint assignment, I wasas tasked to design a speaker my 12 year old self would have loved. Given I was a nerdy kid who loved Undertale, my design was based off the echo flower.</p>
