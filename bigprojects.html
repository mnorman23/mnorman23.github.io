				<summary></summary>
				<p>Our client, the Morton Arboretum, approached us with a problem.
					They were two years behind sorting leaf litter for climate change research.
					Our job? Find a way to make the sorting the small pieces more efficient for their volunteers.
				</p>
				<p>
					We first determined a journey map of this process.
					Looking at the entire journey of the leaf litter from dirt to analysis, we found the biggest slowdown came from the manual sorting process.
				</p>
				<p>
					We designed and built a few low fidelity mockups and received feedback from our client and professionals in various industries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Halfway through, we ended up choosing to go all in on the suction station.
					This is because our users and client preferred using it over other ideas.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few more rounds of iteration and testing later...
				</p>
				<p>
					...leads to our final design!
