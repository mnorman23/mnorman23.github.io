	<h3>I like making silly little things in my free time.</h3>

  <h3>Custom Lasercutting</h3>
	<p>I love making custom designs on the laser cutter as gifts! I have also painted some of them.</p>

  <h3>Resin Dice</h3>
	<p>I spent many months learning the intricacies of resin work to try to make my own dice. They have their flaws, but testing found them balanced and playable!</p>

  <h3>Custom Monopoly Board</h3>
	<p>I photoshopped the existing Ultimate Monopoly board online to be custom to Northwestern. I also made custom cards for chance, community chest, and the deeds. All files are on this google drive to be printed.</p>
  <p>Note: the average Ultimate Monopoly game ends <em>when the first player goes bankrupt</em>, and this still takes approximately <em>three hours per playthrough</em>.</p>

  <h3>Art</h3>
	<p>I dabble in many forms of art, but my favorites arm black and color inks. A variety of my work is available here.</p>
